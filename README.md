Weekend Jquery Server Calculator
## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The assignment wanted us to make a calculator that added, subtracted, multiplied, and divded. It also wanted us to add a clear button for the inputs and a list of all prior history. 

Another goal was that this had to be done with server content as well as client content so you couldn't entirely do it on one side. 

This was accomplished by using GET and POST commands within AJAX.. This allows us to send materials back and forth between the client and the server. SO that the client could input numbers and send them to the server. Where the server would do the math and input back the numbers for the client to properly display them on the screen.
